			<p>Chiropractic health is focused on the diagnosis and treatment of neuromuscular disorders. Through this service, our chiropractor will treat you with an emphasis on manual adjustment and manipulation of your spine.
			Chiropractic medicine seeks to reduce pain and improve patients functionality. Our chiropractors will educate you on how you improve your health through exercise, ergonomics, and other treatments.</p>
			<h2>Alternative Medicine</h2>
			<p>Although chiropractic medicine is considered an alternative medicine, our chiropractors focus on the intimate relationship between the nervous system and spine. 
			It is important to visit our chiropractor because biomechanical and structural derangement of the spine can affect your nervous system. For most conditions,
			chiropractic medicine can restore the structural integrity of your spine which will help reduce pressure on your neurological tissue. Overall, chiropractic medicine will improve your health.</p>
