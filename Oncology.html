			<p>Oncology is a medical specialty that researches, identifies, and treats all kinds of cancer. Our oncologist will diagnose your cancer via:
			<li>biopsy</li>
			<li>endoscopy</li>
			<li>X-ray</li>
			<li>CT scan</li>
			<li>MRI</li>
			<li>PET scan</li>
			<li>ultrasound</li>
			<li>other radiological methos</li>
			Your cancer can also be diagnosed through nuclear medicine, blood tests, or tumor markers.</p>
			<h2>Treatment</h2>
			<p>Once the cancer has been diagnosed, our oncologists discuss the stage of cancer to determine the treatment course of action. 
			<li>Chemotherapy is used to destruct the cancer cells</li>
			<li>Surgery is used to remove the cancerous tumor</li>
			<li>Hormone therapy is used to treat prostate and breast cancers</li></p>
			<h2>Palliative Care</h2>
			<p>Palliative care is given to our cancer patients to improve their quality of life. It is used to address the patient as a whole and not just their disease. It is necessary to prevent and treat the cancer
			as soon as possible and manage the symptoms and side effects of the disease. Our oncologists address physical symptoms, emotional care, coping techniques, ensure spiritual health, caregiver needs, and practical needs in their palliative care plans.</p>
